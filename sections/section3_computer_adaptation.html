<p>The goal of the computer adaptation should be to free the players of the tedious mathematics and management while also maintaining the charming aspects as well as the intentional design and function. Below is a list of the components as understood by this writer, and their proposed adaptations.</p>

Should mimic board's display of Environ information. Would be nice to be able to re-skin battle setting to match location.</p>

For instance, the loyalty scale takes a lot of space being a physical system, but with the substitution of a color scheme and representing icon could be cut down to one squar. Same can be said for other planet characteristics.</p>

This is because due to screen limitations, players will likely only be able to view one province at a time, and navigate between them from a large galaxy map.</p>

                                <p class="list-group-item-text">Character pieces can be very similar to the table implementation. When viewing the game board you cannot see into the stacks at various planets any details of the individuals, until you pick up the pieces to examine. Mimicing this behavior, we need only to display the quantity and possibly total group strength of the entire stack, and then if player examines, show the exact composition, likely linking to the corresponding cards.</p>

For this reason it should be an aim to provide character portraits, item views, etc for all cards just as is done in the board game. These "cards" will be presented to the player as simply the more detailed view of the pieces on the map.</p>
