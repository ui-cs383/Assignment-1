<p>The goal of the computer adaptation should be to free the players of the tedious mathematics and management, while maintaining the charming aspects and the intentional design and function. Below is a list of the components and their proposed adaptations.</p>

                                <p class="list-group-item-text">Environ are the smallest unit of the gameboard, and thus present a challenge for adaptation as screen size and resolution is an issue. An auto-zoom mechanism may be a possible solution for this. The adaptation should mimic the board's display of Environ information. Making the battle setting skinnable to match the location would add depth to the interface.</p>

                                <p class="list-group-item-text">Planets should mimic the board design; however, there are some places digital adapatation may save us space and thus shrink the size of the game map. For instance, the loyalty scale uses much space as a physical system, but with the substitution of a color scheme and representative icon could be cut down to one square. The same can be said for other planet characteristics.</p>

                                <p class="list-group-item-text">Provinces will need to be adapted to allow for a jigsaw puzzle-like size and fit of each individual province. This is because, due to screen limitations, players will likely only be able to view one province at a time, and will need to navigate between them from a large galaxy map.</p>

                                <p class="list-group-item-text">Character pieces can be very similar to the table implementation. When viewing the game board, the player cannot see into the stacks at various planets any details of the individuals, until they pick up the pieces for examination. To mimic this behavior, we need to display only the quantity and total group strength of the entire stack, until the player 'picks up' a piece. We will then display an 'examination view' that shows the exact composition, and links to the corresponding cards.</p>

For this reason it should be a goal to provide character portraits, item views, etc. for all cards just as is done in the board game. These "cards" will be presented to the player as  the more detailed view of the pieces on the map.</p>
