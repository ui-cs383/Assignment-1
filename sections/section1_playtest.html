<p>The Star System game allows the players to adequately familiarize themselves with a few different aspects of the game. The most notable of these was the Mission Phase, which is arguably one of the more important phases for the Rebel player (at least early game, when considering the Province/Galaxy renditions). And in the process of learning the Mission Phase, you will inevitably encounter character combat, either against other characters, squads (stacked military units), irate locals, or creatures.</p>
 
<p>Though not a lot of opportunities were presented for either player to detect one another, there were plenty of searches performed, which were often uneventful. Military action never amounted to much, seeing as how the Rebels had difficulties amassing any kind of power in so few rounds of play, and because only one star system was in use, space combat was not permitted, and the potential for movement was limited.</p>
 
<p>Outlined below is a step by step play through of all the phases for the Rebels and Imperials first turn; a single game turn.</p>

<p>By the end of the fourth turn, the Rebel player had been completely eradicated, with all their characters either being killed or captured by the Imperials. Furthermore, only one instance of military combat was initiated when the Rebels were able to convert a militia unit via the Mission Phase; the fight was over before it began.</p>
